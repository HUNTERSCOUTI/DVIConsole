<h1 align="center"> DVI "WineSys" </h1>

<h2 aling="center"> This is a project called WineSys for my exam </h2>

The point of the project is supposed to be a software for a company called DVI. We've been given a database where it's sending out data constantly in methods.
We're then displaying them and making it update every 5 minutes.

The webservice can't run on core, so the project is on .NET Framework 4.7.2

We got told we could implement news, so I've taken an RSS site from the website of "NordJyske.dk" and made a scrolling text at the bottom.
